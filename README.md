# is (is) an inspector for your environment

## What is `is`?

`is` is an inspector for your environment. It tries to make it a little bit
easier to run commands which rely on a specific OS or a specific CLI version.

### Quick Examples

#### Is the minimum version of this tool available?

```bash
$ is command git gt 2.40.0 && echo ü•≥ || echo üò¢
```

#### Is this the target Operating System?
```bash
$ (is os name eq darwin && echo üçè ) || (is os name eq linux && echo üêß)
```

#### Do we have go? Then update `go` binaries used by `vim-go`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if eval is there go; then
    nvim +':GoUpdateBinaries' +qa || true
fi
```

#### Extracting Versions of Available Tools

Forget about the remembering the different `version` incantations of command
line tools. Don't make up regexes to extract the actual version number.

### Go (version)

```text
$ go version
go version go1.20.4 darwin/arm64
```

```text
$ is known command-version go
1.20.4
```

### Perl (--version)

```text
$ perl --version

This is perl 5, version 36, subversion 1 (v5.36.1) built for darwin-2level

```

```text
$ is known command-version perl
v5.36.1
```

### tmux (-V)

```text
$ tmux -V
tmux 3.3a
```

```text
$ is known command-version tmux
3.3a
```



## How Does it Work?

`is` returns an exit code of `0` on success and non-zero (usually `1`) on failure. You can leverage this in shell scripting:

In a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if eval is os name eq darwin; then
  # This is a Mac. Creating karabiner config dir."
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/karabiner"
fi
```

At the command line:

```bash
is os name ne darwin && echo "this is not a mac"
```

## `is os name`: Check OS Name

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`

### Equality

```text
is os name eq darwin
```

### Inequality

```text
is os name ne linux
```

## `is command`: Check Command version

Available comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `lte`
* `eq`
* `gte`
* `gt`
* `ne`

```text
is command go lt 1.20.5

is command go eq 1.20.4

is command go gt 1.20.3

is command go ne 1.20.2
```

## `is there`: Check if Command is Available

```text
is there tmux && echo "we have tmux"
```

## `is known`: Print Information Without Testing It

```text
$ is known command-version tmux
3.3a
```

```text
$ is known os name
darwin
```

## `--debug`: Get Hints in Debug Mode

```text
$ is os name eq darwins --debug
Comparison failed: darwin eq darwins
```
