## Introduction

`is` is an inspector for your environment. `is` tries to make it just a little bit
easier to run commands which rely on a specific OS or a specific CLI version.

### Is the minimum version of this tool available?

```bash
is command git gt 2.40.0 && echo ü•≥ || echo üò¢
```

### Is this the target Operating System?

```bash
(is os name eq darwin && echo üçè ) || (is os name eq linux && echo üêß)
```

### Do we have go? Then update go binaries used by vim-go

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if eval is there go; then
    nvim +':GoUpdateBinaries' +qa || true
fi
```
Or, as a one-liner:

```text
is there go && nvim +':GoUpdateBinaries' +qa
```

### What's the version of bash?

```text
$ is known cli version bash
5.2.15
```

## Exit Codes are Everything

`is` returns an exit code of `0` on success and non-zero (usually `1`) on failure. You can leverage this in shell scripting:

In a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if eval is os name eq darwin; then
  # This is a Mac. Creating karabiner config dir."
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/karabiner"
fi
```

At the command line:

```bash
is os name ne darwin && echo "this is not a mac"
```

## Top Level Commands

### cli

Compare versions of available commands. Returns exit code of 0 if condition is true and exit code of 1 if condition is false.

```text

Supported comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `lte`
* `eq`
* `gte`
* `gt`
* `ne`

```


### there

```text

```

### known

## Installation

* [Download a release](https://github.com/oalders/is/releases)
* `go install`
  * `go install github.com/oalders/is@latestgithub.com/oalders/is@latest`
  * `go install github.com/oalders/is@latestgithub.com/oalders/is@v0.0.5`
* Use [ubi](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eux

INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/local/bin"

if [ ! "$(command -v ubi)" ]; then
    curl --silent --location \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/houseabsolute/ubi/master/bootstrap/bootstrap-ubi.sh |
        TARGET=$INSTALL_DIR sh
fi

ubi --project oalders/is --in "$INSTALL_DIR"
```

## Extracting Versions of Available Tools

Forget about the remembering the different `version` incantations of command
line tools. Don't make up regexes to extract the actual version number.

### Go (version)

```text
$ go version
go version go1.20.4 darwin/arm64
```

```text
$ is known command-version go
1.20.4
```

### Perl (--version)

```text
$ perl --version

This is perl 5, version 36, subversion 1 (v5.36.1) built for darwin-2level

```

```text
$ is known command-version perl
v5.36.1
```

### tmux (-V)

```text
$ tmux -V
tmux 3.3a
```

```text
$ is known command-version tmux
3.3a
```
